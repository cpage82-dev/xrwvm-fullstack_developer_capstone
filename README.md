## **Introduction to Capstone Project: Scenario and Review Criteria**

A national car dealership with local branches spread across the United States recently conducted a market survey. One of the suggestions that emerged from the survey was that customers would find it beneficial if they could access a central database of dealership reviews across the country.

You are a new hire at the company. You are assigned the task of building a website that allows new and existing customers to look up different branches by state and look at customer reviews of the various branches. Customers should be able to create an account and add their review for any of the branches. The management hopes this will bring transparency to the system and also increase the trust customers have in the dealership.

After thorough research and brainstorming, the team developed use cases for anonymous, authorized, and admin users.
